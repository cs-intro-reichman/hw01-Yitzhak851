// 4. Triangle
// Three sides can form a triangle if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the
// length of the remaining side. This is known as the Triangle Inequality Theorem. For example, the
// three numbers 3, 4, 5 form a triangle, and the three numbers 2, 3, 6 donâ€™t form a triangle. Write
// a program (Triangle.java) that tests if three given integers form a triangle. Examples:
// % java Triangle 3 4 5
// 3, 4, 5: true
// % java Triangle 2 3 6
// 2, 3, 6: false
