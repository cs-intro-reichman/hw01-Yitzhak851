// 3. Linear Equation Solver
// Write a program (LinearEq.java) that solves linear equations of the form 𝑎 ⋅ 𝑥 + 𝑏 = 𝑐. The
// program gets a, b, and c as command-line arguments, computes x, and prints the result. Assume
// that a is not zero. The program treats the three arguments as well as the computed value as
// double values. The program prints the equation and its solution. Examples:
// % java LinearEq 2 5 19
// 2.0 * x + 5.0 = 19.0
// X = 7.0
// % java LinearEq 3 4 5
// 3.0 * x + 4.0 = 5.0
// x = 0.3333333333333333
